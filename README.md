# daily-planner

This application is a daily planner.

This planner is for events from 09:00 to 21:00.

when the page loads a function is ran to check the current time and display it at the top of the page.

based on the hour of the current time each hour-row's background-color is changed to indicate if that hour has passed (gray), that is the current hour (red), or that hour has yet to come (green).

fore example if the current time was 11:00, the 11:00 row would be red, all rows before it would be gray and all rows after, green. 

The user can type whatever they like into the text area for each hour. To save this content press the save button. 

enjoy the planner! https://dtrombla.github.io/daily-planner/
